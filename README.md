# mechanical-vibrations
Using Mathematicanotebooks to simulate various configurations of an simple mechanical systems.

## Objective
Generate equations of motion and perform analysis of various mechanical systems. These systems are comprised of lumped or distributed masses, torsional, linear, and proportional damping, and linear and torsional springs.

This is asccomplished line-by-line using Mathematic's solver and graphing utilities. 

## List of the Different Simulations
- Cantilevered Beam With Excitation And Supported By Linear Spring
- Cart With Inverted Pendulum
- Cart With Pendulum
- Horizontal Pendulum With Springs And Excitation
- Mass String Bridge
- Pinned Beam
- Triple Pendulum With Excitation
